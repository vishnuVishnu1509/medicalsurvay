        <h3 >Health Caring 1</h3>
        <p >Hospitals complement and amplify the effectiveness of many other parts of the health system, providing continuous availability of services for acute and complex conditions. They concentrate scarce resources within well-planned referral networks to respond efficiently to population health needs. They are an essential element of Universal Health Coverage (UHC) and will be critical to meeting the Sustainable Development Goals (SDG)</p>

    <h3 >Health Caring 2</h3>
  <p >When people have complex or serious medical problems, the attending physician sometimes requests that specialists evaluate the person and recommend how to best diagnose and treat the problems. For example, the specialist may be a doctor who is extensively trained in the diagnosis and treatment of disorders of the heart (cardiologist), kidneys (nephrologist), or cancer (oncologist). In other cases, the specialist may be a surgeon who has particular expertise in one area, such as the brain, spine, and nerves (neurosurgeon) or muscles, bones, and joints (orthopedic surgeon.</p>
